## Overview

mayotemplate provides a custom [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org)
template for packages developed at Mayo Clinic. Please donâ€™t use it for
your own package.

Inspired by [tidytemplate](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidytemplate/).

## Using mayotemplate

Include the following in your `_pkgdown.yaml` file:

``` yaml
template:
  package: mayotemplate
```

`mayotemplate` follows the same setup as `tidytemplate`. For more
documentation, please see their README file.
